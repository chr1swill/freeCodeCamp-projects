# freeCodeCamp-projects
My solution to freeCodeCamp challenges and some experiments along the way 

I mainly set this up as a solution to being able to code all day whenever I want and need to. I have a code editor on my phone to pair with this repo. 

I can create files, folders, and most importantly, commit and push via saving files (I can't alter commit messages, though, so the change log will be a nightmare), which allows me to use my phone *"like my laptop" to write code. While storing everything in the cloud.

For anyone looking to set something up like this for themselves, I am using the iPhone app ["Code Editor"](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/code-editor-compiler-ide/id1581290510) to make this happen. 

There is no special reason other than that it is free and allows me to use it for what I need it for.
