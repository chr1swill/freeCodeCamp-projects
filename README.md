# freeCodeCamp-projects
My solution to freeCodeCamp challenges and also some experiments along the way 

I mainly set this up as a solution to being able to code all day whenever I want and need to. I have a code editor on my phone to pair with this repo. 

I can create files, folders, and most importantlu commit and push via saving files (I can't alter commit messages, though, so the change log will be a nightmare), which allows me to use my phone *"like my laptop"* to write code. While storing everything in the cloud.

For anyone looking to setting something up like this for themselves I am using the iPhone app "Code Editor" to make this happen. 

No speacial reason other then it is free and allow me to use it for what I need it for.
